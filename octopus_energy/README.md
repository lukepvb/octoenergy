# octoenergy
Product Page for Octopus Energy 

Directions:

Open application in VSCode or preferred editor.

1. CD into octopus_energy layer (Check to see you are in the right layer by typing 'ls' in the terminal - you should see the client and server folders along w/ webpack.config.js and package.json - this is how you know you are in the right level)
2. Type 'npm install' into the terminal - this will install necessary dependencies for the application
3. Next, type 'npm run dev' to open localhost:8080 on your machine - this command was set up in package.json if you want to take a look
4. The application has been styled to account for IPhone versions 6/7/8 Plus, and a sample media query has been added for IPhone X - if I were to have more time, I would use media-queries to adjust specific components based on the various screen sizes.  For now, right click on the webpage, click on 'Inspect', and change the view to 'IPhone 6/7/8 Plus' or 'IPhone X' - these are the specific screen sizes that I have accounted for


If any of these instructions are unclear, feel free to reach out and I would be happy to clarify.  I will also include screen shots of my version of the application in this README.

Moving forward, I would continue to adapt CSS based on screen size, I would minify everything to optimize performance and reduce file size, I would optimize images, and would take out some of the hardcoding and pull necessary data from the backend to populate some of the frontend components.  Additionally, I would incorporate specific fonts using @font-face, and have them included in dependencies, based on specific styling parameters passed along from UI team.  For this application, I used the PDF provided, because I have already used my free trial of Sketch. 

The application has been set up from scratch, with a custom Webpack config file, and backend folder/file structure to easily be fleshed out.

Thank you!
